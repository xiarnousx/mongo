# Performance and Fault Tolerancy

-   Consider Capped Collections for cases where you want to clear old data automatically
-   Performance is all about having efficient queries/operations, fitting data formats and a best practice MongoDB Server config
-   Replica sets provide fault tolerance with automatic recovery and improved read performance
-   Sharding allows you to scale your MongoDB server horizontally

# Deployment and MongoDB Atlas

-   Deployment is a complex matter since it involves many tasks - some of them are not even directly related to mongDB
-   Unless you are an experienced admin or you got one, you shoul consider a managed solution like MongoDB Atlas
-   Atlas is a managed service where you can configure a MongDB environment and pay as you go model
